\title{De-biased partial coherence
Computes for frequencies Frequencies the de-biased partial coherence (rho) for all u,v.

\usage{
part_coh_de_red(Z, spec, Frequencies, Kernel, M, DEMEAN = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{Discrete Fourier transformed as matrix n (sample size) times p (dimension)}

\item{spec}{estimated f^{-1} at frequencies Frequencies of size p times p times length(Frequencies)}

\item{Frequencies}{Frequencies at which the de-biased partial coherence should be computed}

\item{Kernel}{used kernel in frequency domain as a function with input frequencies and lag window}

\item{M}{lag window for kernel}

\item{DEMEAN}{flag if Z should be centered prior to kernel estimation}
}
\value{
rho_{u,v}(omega), omega in Frequencies, u,v=1,...,p  as array of p times p times length(Frequencies)
